# 00-FRAMEWORK

## Core Framework & Engines

This directory contains the foundational components and engines that power the AMEDEO-P Digital Twin Framework.

### Components

- **core/** - Core services and utilities for the framework
- **quantum-engine/** - Quantum computing simulation capabilities
- **ai-ml/** - AI/ML models and generators for synthetic data
- **synthetic-core/** - Core synthetic data generation engines
- **integration/** - System integration layer for connecting components

### Purpose

The Framework layer provides the fundamental infrastructure and core services that all other layers depend on. This includes:

- Basic utilities and common services
- Quantum simulation capabilities for advanced processing
- AI/ML models for intelligent data generation
- Synthetic data generation engines
- Integration services for seamless component interaction

### Status

This layer forms the backbone of the entire AMEDEO-P system and is essential for all digital twin operations.
