## System Structure

Each structural system follows the AMEDEO-P framework:

```

## Constituent Assemblies (CA)

Each system contains exactly one Constituent Assembly that serves as the primary structural assembly point. The CA manages 10 Configuration Items, each with 11 lifecycle phases.

## Configuration Items (CI)

Each system has 10 Configuration Items representing different aspects of the structural assembly:
1. Primary Structure - Main structural framework
2. Secondary Structure - Supporting structural elements
3. Attachment Points - Connection interfaces
4. Load Transfer - Load distribution elements
5. Material System - Base materials and composites
6. Fastener System - Bolts, rivets, and connections
7. Access Panels - Maintenance access elements
8. Reinforcements - Stress concentration mitigation
9. Protective Elements - Corrosion and damage protection
10. Integration Framework - System integration elements

## Lifecycle Phases

Each Configuration Item follows the 11-phase AMEDEO-P lifecycle:

1. **REQUIREMENTS** - Requirements definition and validation
2. **DESIGN** - Detailed design and analysis
3. **BUILDING-PROTOTYPING** - Prototype development and testing
4. **EXECUTABLES-PACKAGES** - Production packages and tooling
5. **VERIFICATION-VALIDATION** - V&V activities and testing
6. **INTEGRATION-QUALIFICATION** - System integration and qualification
7. **CERTIFICATION-SECURITY** - Certification and security compliance
8. **PRODUCTION-SCALE** - Full-scale production
9. **OPS-SERVICES** - Operational services and support
10. **MRO** - Maintenance, repair, and overhaul
11. **SUSTAINMENT-RECYCLE-EOL** - Sustainment and end-of-life

## Compliance Standards

All structural systems comply with:
- FAA Part 25 (Transport Category Aircraft)
- EASA CS-25 (Certification Specifications)
- MIL-STD-1530D (Aircraft Structural Integrity)
- DO-178C (Software Considerations)
- DO-254 (Hardware Design Assurance)
- ARP4754A (Systems and Equipment Development)

## Digital Twin Integration

Each structural system supports digital twin capabilities:
- Real-time structural monitoring
- Predictive maintenance algorithms
- Fatigue life tracking
- Load spectrum analysis
- Structural health monitoring

## Benefits of Structural Organization

This reorganization provides several advantages:

1. **Real-World Relevance** - Systems correspond to actual aircraft components
2. **Engineering Alignment** - Matches how aircraft are actually designed and built
3. **Maintenance Integration** - Aligns with maintenance and repair practices
4. **Certification Compliance** - Follows certification authority requirements
5. **Industry Standards** - Consistent with aerospace industry practices

## Migration from AMPEL Architecture

The previous AMPEL (Aircraft Multi-Program Enhanced Lifecycle) architecture system has been replaced with this structural-based organization. While AMPEL provided valuable architectural categorization, the new structure better represents the actual physical aircraft components and their relationships.

The AMPEL registry is preserved for historical reference and potential future architectural analysis.
