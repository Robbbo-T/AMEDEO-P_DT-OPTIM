## AMEDEO-P Methodology

Each domain implements the AMEDEO-P segment structure:

| Segment | Focus Area | Examples |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **A** | Architecture/Airframes | Structures, chassis, frames |
| **M** | Mechanical/Maneuvering | Moving parts, actuators, drives |
| **E** | Environmental/Energy | Life support, power systems |
| **D** | Digital/Data | Computing, communication, sensors |
| **E** | Energy/Electrical | Power generation, distribution |
| **O** | Operations/Operating | Control systems, procedures |
| **P** | Propulsion/Platform | Engines, motors, mobility |

## Documentation Structure

Each domain specification includes:
- System architecture overview
- AMEDEO-P segment implementations
- Configuration Item examples
- Lifecycle management practices
- Integration patterns
- Standards and compliance

## Usage

Refer to domain-specific documents for detailed specifications and implementation guidance for each operational domain.
